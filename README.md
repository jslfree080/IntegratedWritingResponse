## The Domestication of Dogs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reading passage argues that the domestication of dogs can be explained by three compelling theories. On the other hand, the lecturer brings up several points to oppose the ideas presented in the reading.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the speaker points out that people would not have adopted wolves as their hunting partners. This is supported by the fact that ancient people set traps and hid quietly nearby, while wolves chased after their prey. This means that it would have been extremely difficult for people to hunt with wolves. Also, it is doubtful that people would have trained wolves because they become more aggressive as they age. This strongly contradicts the author's claim that dogs descended from wolves that were trained by people.
