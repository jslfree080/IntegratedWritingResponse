## Solar Airplane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reading passage argues that the difficulties of an airplane powered <ins>just</ins> by solar energy to <ins>undertake long-haul flights</ins> can be explained by three compelling reasons. On the other hand, the lecturer brings up several points to oppose the ideas presented in the reading.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the speaker points out that an energy reserve generated during the day is used. This is supported by the fact that the panels were made powerful enough to capture solar energy. Moreover, special batteries were designed to store those extra energy that could be supplied to motors even at night. This strongly contradicts the author's claim that it is doubtful how a solar airplane would operate at night.

## Stock Rewards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reading passage argues that the benefits of rewarding employees with company stocks can be explained by three compelling reasons. On the other hand, the lecturer brings up several points to oppose the ideas presented in the reading.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the speaker points out that providing employees with stocks would be a great risk based on previous studies. This is supported by the fact that all of the decisions are risky. This means that there could be a general loss when the decision does not work out well. Moreover, employees ignore the risk of failure and as a result, they could lose money when risk acts do not pay off. This <ins>strongly</ins> contradicts the author's claim that statistical evidence reveals that employees with stocks perform much better than those with no stocks.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, another myth about offering employees stocks is that people think it could improve a company's overall transparency. The reason is that employees who own stocks could overstate sales and understate expenses. Also, it is doubtful that company managers try to be authentic for the sake of public perception of the company because they are motivated to exaggerate the company's performance for the sake of their own. <ins>This casts doubt on the author's assertion that</ins> offering employees with stocks increases the company's overall authenticity.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the professor asserts that investors nowadays are suspicious of a company's rewarding act with stocks. This is because they are aware of the fact that things get easily influenced. In addition, investors would avoid investing in such companies because they think it may not pay off. This goes against the writer's view that confident investors would invest in companies.<br/>
